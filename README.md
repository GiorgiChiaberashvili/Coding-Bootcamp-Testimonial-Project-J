## My process

I was planning on starting working with (TailWind) TW on the front side and React but changed plans a bit but starting with React for the next Project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Javascript
- and with bunch of Love.

### What I learned

Overall I learned Testimonial type of project for the first time. It wasnt easy and took me quite a bit of time. I know my code looks messy on the CSS end and its far from perfect and clean but I tried my best to maintain it. Will be working on improving my skills.

HTML: AS for wording nothing new for that part. But new as overall testimonial type of structure

CSS: A lot of work invested to make slide Testimonial function to work. Code looks messy not really proud of that on this one but will be working on improvement.

Javascript: Created 2 helper functions one which toggles hode and another show. Initially first slide set to block while another to display none. Eventlisteners for two buttons ofr changing slides.

 It was amazing practice learning how to work toggle back and forth on different testimonial pages.
